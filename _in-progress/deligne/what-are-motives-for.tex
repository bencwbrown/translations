\oldpage{143}
The first of the ``standard conjectures'' (Grothendieck~\cite{19}, Kleiman~\cite{20}), the Lefschetz-style one, says that certain cohomology classes are algebraic.
Anyway, if motives are the ``direct factors'' of algebraic varieties $X$ defined by projectors (algebraic cycles on $X\times X$), then their definition is only reasonable if we have enough algebraic cycles.
On this problem --- the construction of interesting algebraic cycles --- progress has been sparse.

Grothendieck tried to establish a catalogue of projective constructions of cycles (\todo), cf. \cite[p.~197]{19}.
For those for which we have calculated their cohomology class, the class can be expressed in terms of Chern classes of obvious vector bundles.
Even though I do not know of any counterexamples, it seems unlikely to me that the ring of cycle classes on $X\times X$ generated by the diagonal, the divisors, and the inverse images of the Chern classes of $X$ by the $\pr_i$ (for $i=1,2$) will always contain the cycles required by the first standard conjecture (for example, the K\"{u}nneth components of the diagonal).

Instead of trying to construct cycles, we can try to construct vector bundles, and then take their Chern classes.
It is, in fact, like this that K.~Kodaira and D.C.~Spencer (1953) prove the Hodge conjecture for divisors (a theorem of Lefschetz), with the group $\Pic(X)=H^1(X,\sh{O}^*)$ being accessible, over $\CC$, by the exponential exact sequence
\[
  0 \to 2\pi i\ZZ \to \sh{O} \to \sh{O}^* \to 0.
\]
Similarly, on an abelian variety, it is easier to write the functional equation of the $\Theta$ functions (a cocycle for a line bundle) than to define a $\Theta$ function, itself giving the divisor $\Theta=0$.

\oldpage{144}
Unfortunately, in higher rank, we do not know how to construct vector bundles whose Chern classes are interesting any more than we know how to construct interesting cycles.

Over $\CC$, the Hodge conjecture would give the desired cycles.
Two difficulties in proving this conjecture have been found.
The first: Atiyah and Hirzebruch have shown that it could only be true rationally (cf. Atiyah-Hirzebruch~\cite{1}).

The second: from the point of view of Hodge theory, the class of a cycle $Z$ of codimension $d$ on a smooth projective $X$ lives naturally, not in $H_\ZZ^{d,d}:=H^{d,d}\cap H_\ZZ$, but in an extension $E_d$ of this group by the intermediate Jacobian:
\[
  J^d(X) := H^{2d-1}(X,\CC)/F^d + H^{2d-1}(X,\ZZ),
\]
where $F^d$ denotes the $d$-th term of the Hodge filtration of $H^{2d-1}(X,\CC)$.
In the category of mixed Hodge structures, this is, respectively, $\Hom(\ZZ(d),H^{2d}(X))$ and $\Ext^1(\ZZ(d),H^{2d-1}(X))$.
The Hodge conjecture says that the group of cycle classes is sent to a subgroup of finite index of the quotient $H_\ZZ^{d,d}$.
However, we have no idea what should be the image in $E_d$.
Furthermore, the aesthetic awkwardness that causes this ignorance renders the methods of P.A.~Griffiths, to prove the Hodge conjecture by induction on the dimension of the variety $X$, generally inapplicable.
This method is inspired by that which Lefschetz~\cite{24} uses for surfaces.
The idea is that, if $(H_t)_{t\in\PP^1}$ is a \todo of hyperplane sections, then constructing the cycle $Z$ on $X$ reduces to constructing the cycles $Z_i=Z\cap H_t$.
In good cases:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item the cohomology class $c\in H_\ZZ^{d,d}(X)$ that we wish to be that of a cycle $Z$ restricts to zero on the $H_t$;
  \item if $Z$ exists, then its cohomology class $c$ determines the class of the $Z_t$ in the intermediate Jacobians $J^d(H_t)$; and
  \item the construction of $Z$ reduces to constructing the cycles $Z_t$ of classes defining a given section of the family of the $J^d(H_t)$.
\end{enumerate}
We can thus conclude that every element of $J^d(H_t)$ is the class of a cycle of codimension $d$ that is cohomologous to zero.
Using this method, Zucker~\cite{32} proves the Hodge conjecture for cubic hypersurfaces in $\PP^5$.
Note, however, that, if every element of $J^d(H_t)$ is the class of a cycle that is cohomologous to zero, then $H^{2d-1}(H_t)$ is of Hodge type $\{(d,d-1)(d-1,d)\}$ (see \cref{1.6}), and the converse is a consequence of the Hodge conjecture applied to the product of $H_t$ with a suitable abelian variety.
Furthermore, this surjectivity implies the existence of a curve $C_t$ and an algebraic cycle $W_t$ on $H_t\times C_t$ that sends $H^1(C_t)$ to $H^{2d-1}(H_t)$.
We can then expect that $H^{2d}(X)$ is controlled by the $H^2$ of the surface fibred over $\PP^1$ with fibres given by the $C_t$, and, for an $H^2$, we can use the Hodge conjecture anyway.

\oldpage{145}
The aim of these notes is to show that, despite this lack of progress on the problem of constructing cycles, the philosophy of motives is a powerful tool.

I thank S.~Bloch for his comments on a first version of these notes.


\section{Motives}
\label{1}

According to what we can and want to do, we have various definitions of motives available to us --- or even none.
We need to distinguish pure motives, typically given by the cohomology of non-singular projective varieties, and mixed motives, where open and singular varieties are allowed.
The notion of a motive on $S$ (a family of motives parametrised by $S$) poses yet more problems.

\subsection{}
\label{1.1}

For a field $k$, we always want the category of motives over $k$ to be a $\QQ$-linear abelian category $\sh{M}(k)$ with finite-dimensional $\Hom$ groups.
In the pure case, we want it to be semi-simple and graded (by weights).
In the mixed case, every motive $M$ should admit a finite increasing filtration $W$, with $\Gr_n^W(M)$ pure of weight~$n$.
Some other essential structures are the following:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item Every algebraic variety $X$ on $k$ should have motivic cohomology groups $H_\mot^i(X)$, which are objects of $\sh{M}(k)$.
    In the pure case, we restrict to non-singular projective varieties $X$, and $H_\mot^i(X)$ should then be a pure motive of weight~$i$.
  \item For each of the usual cohomology theories $H$, we should have a ``realisation'' functor $\real$, and isomorphisms
    \[
      H^i(X) = \real H_\mot^i(X).
    \]
  \item There should be a tensor product $\otimes$, with which the realisation functors are compatible.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{}
\label{1.2}

The tensor product structure described above allows us to apply the theory of Tannakian categories, invented by Grothendieck to study the formalism of motives.
References: Saavedra~\cite{28}, Deligne--Milne~\cite{12}, Deligne~\cite{15}.

For $k$ of characteristic~$0$, this theory says that the category of motives over $k$, with its tensor product, should be equivalent to the category of linear representations of a scheme $G$ of affine groups over $\QQ$.
Note that any two groups $G_1$ and $G_2$ \todo(?with one sitting inside the other?) have the same category of representations.
The \emph{motivic Galois group} $G$ is thus not uniquely determined by $\sh{M}(k)$.
The theory tells us that a choice of $G$ and of an equivalence $\sh{M}(k)\simeq\Rep(G)$ is equivalent to the choice of an exact functor to $\QQ$-vector spaces that is compatible with the tensor product of $\sh{M}(k)$: a \emph{fibre functor} $\omega$.
To such an $\omega$ corresponds $G:=\underline{\Aut}^\otimes(\omega)$, the group scheme of $\otimes$-automorphisms of $\omega$.
We can think of $\omega$, or, rather, $\omega\circ H_\mot$, as a cohomology theory with values in $\QQ$-vector spaces.

\oldpage{146}
If we have an embedding of $k$ into $\CC$, then a possible cohomology theory is: ``singular cohomology of the topological space of complex points''.
For $k=\QQ$, another possible choice is ``de Rham cohomology''.

In characteristic~$p$, an example by Serre shows that there cannot be any reasonable cohomology theory with values in $\QQ$-vector spaces: if $E$ is a supersingular elliptic curve, then the algebra $\End(E)\otimes\QQ$ is a quaternion algebra, and thus has no linear representation of dimension~$2$ over $\QQ$.
From the existence of a cohomology theory with values in vector spaces over an extension of $\QQ$ it follows, however, that $\sh{M}(k)$ should be the category of representations of a suitable gerbe.

The Tannakian theory is a \emph{linear} analogue of a \emph{set-theoretic} theory, namely that of the profinite $\pi_1$, also due to Grothendieck (\cite{SGA1}).
The analogy is as follows: if $\sh{R}$ is the category of finite \'{e}tale covers of a connected scheme $S$ (resp. a Tannakian category over $K$), and $\omega$ is a fibre functor, with values in finite sets (resp. in finite-dimensional $K$-vector spaces), then $\sh{R}$ is naturally equivalent to the category of finite $G$-sets (resp. of representations of $G$), where $G$ is the profinite group $\Aut(\omega)$ (resp. the affine group scheme $\underline{\Aut}^\otimes(\omega)$).
From here we get the terminology ``motivic Galois group'', with the $\pi_1$ theory, in the case of spectra of fields, becoming the Galois version.

\subsection{}
\label{1.3}

In general, the motivic Galois group $G$ is enormous.
For example, except for when $k$ is algebraic over a finite field, we expect $G$ to admit $\mathrm{PGL}(2)^{\operatorname{card}(k)}$ as a quotient.
It ``doesn't know'' that motives $M_t$ can form a family that depends algebraically on $t$.

Even though $G$ is enormous, its existence facilitates the handling of ``motivic'' objects.

\begin{example}
  The category $\ind\sh{M}(k)$ of ind-objects of the category $\sh{M}(k)$ of motives over $k$ inherits the tensor product from $\sh{M}(k)$.
  This allows us to define a commutative Hopf algebra in $\ind\sh{M}(k)$ as being an object $H$ endowed with a product $H\otimes H\to H$ and coproduct $H\to H\otimes H$, as well as a unit $1\to H$, counit $H\to 1$, and antipode $H\to H$, satisfying suitable axioms.
  We define the category of \emph{motivic affine group schemes} as being the opposite of the category of commutative Hopf algebras in $\ind\sh{M}(k)$.
  If $\omega$ is a fibre functor, with values in $\QQ$-vector spaces, from the motivic Galois group $G:=\underline{\Aut}^\otimes(\omega)$, then the functor $\omega$ induces an equivalence between $\ind\sh{M}(k)$ and the category of linear representations --- not necessarily of finite dimension --- of $G$, and $H\mapsto\Spec\omega(H)$ is an equivalence between the category of motivic affine group schemes and the category of affine group schemes over $\QQ$ endowed with an action of $G$.
\end{example}

Here are three examples of such objects.

\subsubsection{}
\label{1.3.1}

The motivic version of $\pi_1(X,x)$ made unipotent, cf. Deligne~\cite{14}, especially §§5, 7, and 10 to 13.

\oldpage{147}
\subsubsection{}
\label{1.3.2}

The motivic Galois group: there exists a motivic version $G_\mot$ such that, for every fibre functor $\omega$, the corresponding motivic Galois group is given by the application of $\omega$ to $G_\mot$.
This gives a construction that works in any Tannakian category, cf. Deligne~\cite[\S8]{15}.
In the analogy with the profinite-$\pi_1$ theory, its analogue is the following: for varying $x$, the $\pi_1(X,x)$ form a local system on $X$, or, more precisely, an group object in the category of pro-objects of the category of \'{e}tale covers of $X$.
The $\pi_1$ at $x$ is obtained by taking its fibre at $x$.

\subsubsection{}
\label{1.3.3}

Let $\sh{M}$ be a full subcategory of the category of mixed motives over $k$, stable under $\otimes$, taking duals, and sub-quotients, and let $\sh{M}_\mathrm{pur}$ be the full subcategory of direct sums of pure motives in $\sh{M}$.
We have an exact functor that is compatible with the tensor product, given by $M\mapsto\Gr^W(M)$, from $\sh{M}$ to $\sh{M}_\mathrm{pur}$.
In $\sh{M}_\mathrm{pur}$ there exists a motivic pro-unipotent group scheme $U$, acting functorially on $\Gr^W(M)$ for $M$ in $\sh{M}$, and such that $M\mapsto\Gr^W(M)$ is an equivalence between $\sh{M}$ and the category of representations (in $\sh{M}_\mathrm{pur}$) of $U$.
This is a consequence of Deligne~\cite[8.17]{15}.

We can similarly define and work with motivic schemes, motivic torsors, \ldots{}.


\subsection{}
\label{1.4}

The abelianisation $G^\ab$ of the motivic Galois group $G$ is of a more reasonable size.
It is independent of the chosen realisation functor (and of its existence).
Conjecturally, if $k_1\subset k_2$ are algebraically closed fields, then $G^\ab$ is the same for $k_1$ and $k_2$, and the corresponding subcategory of motives is generated by the $H_\mot^1$ of CM-type abelian varieties.

In characteristic~$0$, if we take ``motives'' to mean absolute Hodge cycles, and we restrict to the subcategory generated by the $H^1$ of abelian varieties, then we know how to calculate $G^\ab$.
For $\sh{M}(\QQ)$, we even know how to calculate the quotient of $G$ by the derived group of $\Ker(G\to\Gal(\overline{\QQ}/\QQ))$.
See Deligne~\cite{13} or the talk by Schappacher at this conference.

For $\sh{M}(\FF_q)$, every motive should be a direct sum of pure motives, and the motivic Galois group should contain an element $F$, the Frobenius, whose powers are dense in $G$.
In particular, $G$ should be commutative.
The conjectural calculation of $\sh{M}(\FF_q)$ was made by Grothendieck (unpublished).
See Langlands--Rapoport~\cite{23} and the talk by Milne at this conference.


\subsection{}
\label{1.5}

One source of \cref{1.1}~(a) and (b) is the following example.
A smooth projective curve $X$ defines its Jacobian via $J(X)=\Pic^0(X)$.
Abelian varieties, up to isogeny, over $k$ form a semi-simple abelian category, with the $\Hom(A,B)$ being finite-dimensional over $\QQ$, and, for every usual cohomology theory $H$, the dual $H_1(X)$ of $H^1(X)$ is given by applying a ``realisation'' functor to $J(X)$.
Note that $H_1(X)$ is also the twist \`{a} la Tate $H^1(X)(1)$ of $H^1(X)$.
For $\ell$-adic cohomology, $\real_\ell(A)$ is the Tate module $V_\ell(A)=T_\ell(A)\otimes\QQ_\ell$.
For $k$ of characteristic~$0$, and
\oldpage{148}
de Rham cohomology, $\real_{\mathrm{DR}}(A)$ is the Lie algebra given by the universal additive extension of $A$.

We thus wish to be able to identify abelian varieties with certain motives of weight $-1$.
For some applications (for example, the study of Shimura varieties), we would be content with even having a category of motives that contains abelian varieties and is stable under $\otimes$.
In characteristic~$0$, the theory of absolute Hodge cycles gives us such a theory (Deligne--Brylinksi~\cite{11}, Deligne--Milne~\cite{12}, or the talk by Panschishkin at this conference).
If we do not restrict ourselves to pure motives, then another key example is that of smooth curves that are not necessarily complete.
More generally, we can consider a smooth projective curve $\overline{X}$, disjoint $S$ and $T$ in $\overline{X}$, and the cohomology $H^1(\overline{X}\setminus S,\operatorname{rel}T)$.
A \emph{$1$-motive} $K^\bullet$ is a complex of group schemes concentrated in degrees $-1$ and $0$, such that, over the algebraic closure, $K^{-1}$ is a free $\ZZ$-module of finite type, and $K^0$ is an extension of an abelian variety by a torus.
Suppose, for simplicity, that $k$ is algebraically closed.
For every usual cohomology theory, the $H^1$ in question, or even its twist \`{a} la Tate $H^1(\overline{X}\setminus S,\operatorname{rel}T)(1)$, is then given by applying a realisation functor to the following $1$-motive.

Let $J_T(\overline{X})$ be the generalised Jacobian classifying invertible sheaves of degree~$0$ over $\overline{X}$ that are trivialised over $T$.
This is an extension of the abelian variety $\Pic^0(\overline{X})$ by the character group torus $\Ker(\ZZ^T\xrightarrow{\Sigma}\ZZ)$.
Each $s\in S$ defines an invertible sheaf $\sh{O}(s)$, trivialised over $T$ and of degree~$1$, whence
\[
\label{1.5.1}
  \Ker(\ZZ^S\to\ZZ) \to J_T(\overline{X}).
\tag{1.5.1}
\]
This is the aforementioned $1$-motive.
See Deligne~\cite[§10]{9}.

\begin{remark}
  For $S,T\neq\varnothing$, the $1$-motive \cref{1.5.1} also determines the category of invertible sheaves on $\overline{X}\setminus S$, trivialised over $T$: a point $x\in J_T(\overline{X})$ defines such an invertible sheaf $\sh{L}_x$, and an isomorphism from $\sh{L}_x$ to $\sh{L}_y$ which is the identity on $T$ is identified with $k\in\Ker(\ZZ^S\to\ZZ)$, with $y-x=\delta k$.
\end{remark}

Again, we wish to be able to identify $1$-motives with certain (mixed) motives.
For some applications (the study at infinity of Shimura varieties), we would be content with even having a category of motives that contains the $1$-motives and is stable under $\otimes$.
In characteristic~$0$, we know how to do this (Brylinksi~\cite{7}).
