\section*{Introduction}
\label{section:introduction}

If a reductive algebraic group $G$ acts on a projective algebraic variety $X$, all over an algebraically closed field, the data of an $G$-linearised ample line bundle $L$ on $X$ allows us to define the open subset of stable points of $X$.
The quotient (in the usual sense of orbit spaces) of this open subset $X^s=X^s(L)$ by $G$ exists;
it is a quasi-projective variety, denoted by $X^s/G$.
Furthermore, $X^s$ is contained in the open subset $X^{ss}=X^{ss}(L)$ of semi-stable points, and we can again define a ``quotient'' $Y$ of $X^{ss}$ by $G$ (it is the space of closed orbits of $G$ in $X^{ss}$).
The variety $Y$ is projective, and contains $X^s/G$ as an open sub set.
To define it, we introduce the algebra $A:=\oplus_{n=0}^\infty \Gamma(X,L^n)$ and its sub-algebra $A^G$ consisting of invariants of $G$;
then $Y$ is the $\Proj$ of the graded algebra $A^G$.
Thus $Y$ is endowed with a sheaf $\sh{O}(n)$ for every integer $n$, and one of them is invertible.
So we can define the class $1/n[\sh{O}(n)]$ in the Picard group of $Y$, tensored with $\mathbb{Q}$.
This class is ample, and depends only on $X$ and $L$.

Our goal is to study these objects, introduced by Mumford in \cite{MF}, when $G$ is a torus (denoted by $T$).
The idea is to simultaneously consider all the quotients associated to the $T$-linearised bundles $L^n\otimes\sh{O}(\chi)$, where $n$ is a positive integer, and $\sh{O}(\chi)$ is the trivial line bundle on $X$, with the torus acting on each fibre of $\sh{O}(\chi)$ by multiplication by the character $\chi$.
The notion of a stable or semi-stable point for $L^n\otimes\sh{O}(\chi)$ depends only, in fact, on $\chi/n$.
\oldpage{510}
To every quotient $p$ of a character of $T$ by an integer, we can thus associated $X^s(p)$, $X^{ss}(p)$, $Y(p)$, and an ample class $L_p$ in $\Pic_\mathbb{Q}(Y(p))$;
when $p=0$, we recover the above notions.

For simplicity, we assume $L$ to be very ample, i.e. we consider the case where $X$ is a subvariety of a projective space $\PP(V)$, with the torus $T$ acting linearly on $V$, and where $L$ is the restriction of $\sh{O}(1)$ to $X$.
We show that $X^s(p)$, $X^{ss}(p)$, and $Y(p)$ depend only on the position of $p$ relative to a certain finite set $\Pi$ of characters of $T$ (the set of weights of $T$ in $V$).
More precisely, we define \cref{1.1,1.2} a partition of the convex hull $\mathcal{C}$ of $\Pi$ into ``faces''.
Each face is the interior of a convex polyhedron, and $X^s(p)$, $X^{ss}(p)$, and $Y(p)$ depend only on the face of $p$;
for every face $F$, we can define $X^s(F)$, $X^{ss}(F)$, and $Y(F)$.
We further show \cref{1.3} that the map $p\in F\mapsto L_p\in\Pic_\QQ(Y(F))$ is affine.

Let $F$ be an open face of $\mathcal{C}$.
We show that every point that is semistable for $F$ is stable;
thus, if $X$ is smooth, then $Y(F)$ only has singularities from quotients by finite abelian groups.
The quotients associated to the open faces are thus relatively simply.
For an arbitrary face $F$, let $F'$ be an open face whose closure contains $F$.
We define, in \cref{1.4}, a morphism $\pi_{F,F'}\colon Y(F')\to Y(F)$, that is almost always birational.
In \cref{1.5}, we study the case where $F$ is of codimension one, and contained in the closure of the two open faces $F_-$ and $F_+$.
The morphisms $\pi_{F,F_-}$ and $\pi_{F,F_+}$ are, in general, quite complicated;
however, if $\hat{Y}$ denotes the product of $Y(F_-)$ and $Y(F_+)$ over $Y(F)$, then the morphisms from $\hat{Y}$ to $Y(F_-)$, $Y(F)$, and $Y(F_+)$ are blow-ups of subvarieties, with the same exceptional divisor (see \cref{2.3} for a precise statement).

We can extend the affine map $p\mapsto L_p$ from $F_+$ to $\Pic_\QQ(Y_+)$ to $\mathcal{C}$, and then lift each $L_p$ to $\hat{Y}$, giving a class $L_p^+$;
we define $L_p^-$ similarly.
We show in \cref{2.3} that the difference $L_p^+ - L_p^-$ is a multiple of the exceptional divisor $\hat{Y}\to Y(F)$, and is zero for all $p\in F$.
Then, when we consider the product $\bar{Y}$ of the quotients associated to all the faces, over all the morphisms $\pi_{F,F'}$, the maps $p\mapsto L_p$ glue to give a map, piecewise affine \unsure{???} and continuous, from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\Pic_\QQ(\overline{Y})$.

In the third section of this paper, we apply these results to the asymptotic study of multigraded modules;
we consider various extensions of the notions of multiplicity and of the Hilbert--Samuel function for a graded module to these modules.
More precisely, we consider a polynomial algebra $A$, graded by $\NN\times\ZZ^l$ (with the $\NN$-grading being defined by the degree of the polynomials).
We denote by $T$ the torus having $\ZZ^l$ as its group of character.
Every $(\NN\times\ZZ^l)$-graded $A$-module defines
\oldpage{511}
a $T$-linearised sheaf $\sh{M}$ on the projective space $\PP(V)$ associated to $A$.
Let $\Pi$ be the set of weights of $T$ in $V$, i.e. \unsure{opposites? duals? of $\ZZ^l$-degrees?} of generators of $A$.
For every face $F$ associated to $\Pi$, let $\sh{M}^{(F)}$ be the sheaf given by invariants of $T$ in $(\pi_F)_*(\sh{M})$, where $\pi_F\colon X^{ss}(F)\to Y(F)$ is the ``quotient''.
We show that, if $M$ is an $A$-module of finite type, then $\sh{M}^{(F)}$ is a coherent sheaf on $Y(F)$.
For every $p\in F$, we denote by $\mu_M(p)$ the degree of $\sh{M}^{(F)}$ relative to the ample class $L_p$ (see \cite[I.3]{Kle}).
We show that the function $\mu_M$ is polynomial on each face.
Furthermore, it appears as the density in various integral expressions of asymptotic invariants of $M$: the ``generalised Hilbert--Samuel polynomials'' \cref{3.5}, and the ``Joseph polynomials'' (\cite{Jos}; see \cref{3.6}).
If $M$ is the homogeneous coordinate ring of a smooth projective subvariety $X$ of $\PP(V)$, then the function $\mu_M$ is continuous, and its Fourier transform depends only on fixed points of $T$ in $X$, and on their normal bundle \cref{3.4}.

Finally, in an appendix, we briefly explain the links between our results and some theorems due to Atiyah, Duistermaat--Heckman, Guillemin--Sternberg in symplectic geometry (see \cite{Ati}, \cite{DH12}, and \cite{GS12}).
Indeed, there are close links, studied in \cite{Kir}, between the algebraic action of a complex torus on a subvariety $X$ of a projective space and the Hamiltonian action of its compact maximal sub-torus $T_c$ on $X$ considered as a symplectic variety (the symplectic form being the imaginary part of a K\"{a}hler form on $\PP(V)$ that is invariant under $T_c$).
