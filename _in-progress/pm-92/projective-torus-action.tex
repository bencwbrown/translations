\section*{Introduction}
\label{section:introduction}

If a reductive algebraic group $G$ acts on a projective algebraic variety $X$, all over an algebraically closed field, the data of an $G$-linearised ample line bundle $L$ on $X$ allows us to define the open subset of stable points of $X$.
The quotient (in the usual sense of orbit spaces) of this open subset $X^s=X^s(L)$ by $G$ exists;
it is a quasi-projective variety, denoted by $X^s/G$.
Furthermore, $X^s$ is contained in the open subset $X^{ss}=X^{ss}(L)$ of semi-stable points, and we can again define a ``quotient'' $Y$ of $X^{ss}$ by $G$ (it is the space of closed orbits of $G$ in $X^{ss}$).
The variety $Y$ is projective, and contains $X^s/G$ as an open sub set.
To define it, we introduce the algebra $A:=\oplus_{n=0}^\infty \Gamma(X,L^n)$ and its sub-algebra $A^G$ consisting of invariants of $G$;
then $Y$ is the $\Proj$ of the graded algebra $A^G$.
Thus $Y$ is endowed with a sheaf $\sh{O}(n)$ for every integer $n$, and one of them is invertible.
So we can define the class $1/n[\sh{O}(n)]$ in the Picard group of $Y$, tensored with $\mathbb{Q}$.
This class is ample, and depends only on $X$ and $L$.

Our goal is to study these objects, introduced by Mumford in \cite{MF}, when $G$ is a torus (denoted by $T$).
The idea is to simultaneously consider all the quotients associated to the $T$-linearised bundles $L^n\otimes\sh{O}(\chi)$, where $n$ is a positive integer, and $\sh{O}(\chi)$ is the trivial line bundle on $X$, with the torus acting on each fibre of $\sh{O}(\chi)$ by multiplication by the character $\chi$.
The notion of a stable or semi-stable point for $L^n\otimes\sh{O}(\chi)$ depends only, in fact, on $\chi/n$.
\oldpage{510}
To every quotient $p$ of a character of $T$ by an integer, we can thus associated $X^s(p)$, $X^{ss}(p)$, $Y(p)$, and an ample class $L_p$ in $\Pic_\mathbb{Q}(Y(p))$;
when $p=0$, we recover the above notions.

For simplicity, we assume $L$ to be very ample, that is, we consider the case where $X$ is a subvariety of a projective space $\PP(V)$, with the torus $T$ acting linearly on $V$, and where $L$ is the restriction of $\sh{O}(1)$ to $X$.
We will show that $X^s(p)$, $X^{ss}(p)$, and $Y(p)$ depend only on the position of $p$ relative to a certain finite set $\Pi$ of characters of $T$ (the set of weights of $T$ in $V$).
More precisely, we will define \cref{1.1,1.2} a partition of the convex hull $\mathcal{C}$ of $\Pi$ into ``faces''.
Each face is the interior of a convex polyhedron, and $X^s(p)$, $X^{ss}(p)$, and $Y(p)$ depend only on the face of $p$;
for every face $F$, we can define $X^s(F)$, $X^{ss}(F)$, and $Y(F)$.
We will further show \cref{1.3} that the map $p\in F\mapsto L_p\in\Pic_\QQ(Y(F))$ is affine.

Let $F$ be an open face of $\mathcal{C}$.
We will show that every point that is semistable for $F$ is stable;
thus, if $X$ is smooth, then $Y(F)$ only has singularities from quotients by finite abelian groups.
The quotients associated to the open faces are thus relatively simply.
For an arbitrary face $F$, let $F'$ be an open face whose closure contains $F$.
